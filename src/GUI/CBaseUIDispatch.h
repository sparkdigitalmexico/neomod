// ============================================================================================
//  CBaseUI input model (read this first)
// ============================================================================================
//  Two ROOTS dispatch every frame in a fixed order: the engine gui root (guiContainer = console/
//  debug, drawn on top) then the app UI root. They share one consumed-state buffer, so the engine
//  root gets first claim on each event and the app root sees only what is left.
//
//  Each root runs in TWO PASSES per frame:
//
//    Pass A - the updateInput walk (CBaseUIElement::updateInput, driven top-most-first by the
//             caller, e.g. UI::update over LAYER_ORDER). It does NOT deliver clicks: each visible+
//             enabled element under the cursor registers as a HIT CANDIDATE on the ctx
//             (CBaseUIEventCtx), snapshots its ancestor path, resolves hover LOSS locally, and
//             broadcasts outside-downs. Transparent wrappers (bClickThroughSelf: containers,
//             screens) register no candidacy of their own.
//
//    Pass B - dispatchEvents (this object). The frame's buffered button/wheel events (collected
//             off the Mouse relay) are routed to those candidates, hover GAIN is resolved, and
//             capture is advanced. One delivery per event, to one element.
//
//  ONE candidate set feeds hover, clicks AND wheel, ranked by ONE function (topCandidate):
//    1. group  - layer/screen order (beginHitGroup per layer; first group walked = top-most)
//    2. tier   - bDrawsOnTop raises an element's (sub)tree above later-visited same-group siblings
//    3. visit  - latest visited within a tier wins (= later sibling draws on top)
//  so the three pickers (hover, click-down, wheel) can never disagree on "what is on top".
//
//  Four routing concerns live in this one object, all keyed off that candidate set:
//    - hover   : the single top-most candidate + its ancestors gain hover (resolveHover)
//    - capture : a down implicitly captures its target; all further buttons + the matching up go
//                to the captor until release (lock/steal/cancel serve the drag widgets)
//    - wheel   : top-most wheel-accepting candidate, else the fall-through sink (VolumeOverlay)
//    - focus   : a single focused element across both roots (the keyboard target)
// ============================================================================================

// pass-B mouse routing + capture state for the CBaseUI layer. one instance, owned by Engine
// alongside the engine gui root; it listens on the same Mouse relay as every other consumer
// (Mouse itself knows nothing about UI routing; consumption state lives in the buffer here).
